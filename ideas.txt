How to implement human vs human game?	

Option 1:
Each game will have DB table with current game state 
Game state should have:
Turn (Player 1 or 2)
Tile states ( touple (xy))
Time between turns. (After what time do we forfeit game?)

Accessing DB:
(Jquery)Ajax and PHP:
When it is current users turn: allow user to click or use keypad to set tile
When not current users turn: disable access to game
Jquery will poll database every n milliseconds for updated game state (how fast do we do this not to overload server but have decent reaction time? Need to test this to be sure)
