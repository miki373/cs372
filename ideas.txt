How to implement human vs human game?	

Option 1:
Each game will have DB table with current game state 
Game state should have:
Turn (Player 1 or 2)
Tile states (tuple (x,y))
Time between turns. (After what time do we forfeit game?)

Accessing DB:
(JQuery)Ajax and PHP: 
When it is current users turn: allow user to click or use keypad to set tile.
When not current users turn: disable access to game
JQuery will poll database every n milliseconds for updated game state (how fast do we do this not to overload server but have decent reaction time? Need to test this to be sure)


Chat:
-Using database table for each game
-Global chat? Global and local?

OTHER IDEAS IF THERE IS TIME:
Check if user is active or not.
If user closes window or minimizes tab set database field and alert other user.
If user inactive for n milliseconds, forfeit game and set database

Game complexity
Allow N * N game, meaning N tiles vertical and N horizontal 
Allow N number of players 
Allow N humans + AI

Sounds:
Play sounds on win/loose

Login:
Allow Facebook, Google account creation/login via api. 


GUI:
-Sketches?
